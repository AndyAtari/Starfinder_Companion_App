# Starfinder Companion

Starfinder Companion is a free and open source character builder for the science-fiction/science fantasy role-playing game, [Starfinder](https://paizo.com/starfinder/). Upon signing in you can create characters, save characters with associated campaigns, create a starship for that campaign, and search for any registered campaign. 

This project was created for Flatiron Portfolio Project Assessment and was made with Ruby on Rails. <br><br>

## Motivation 

Since many rpg sessions are now virtual, it is my desire for Starfinder players to have all their stats and campaign information digitally available. I hope players can use the application to connect with friends to plan and strategize their next space odyssey.   

## Installation

After cloning the repository, 

install bundler: 

```$ bundle```  


## Usage

In your terminal run ```$ rails s``` and start your local server. You can navigate the application through your local port. 


## Roadmap

For future releases, I plan to create detailed character and starship stat sheets. The Starship model will have a method that determines the number of build points based on tier and will subtract those build points as you assemble your ship on the application. I hope to have the application live in the near future.
